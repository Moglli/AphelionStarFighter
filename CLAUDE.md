# CLAUDE.md — Session notes for Aphelion Star Fighter

This file records context for future Claude (or human) sessions: what
the project is, where things live, and what's been changed recently.
**When you make non-trivial changes in a session, append a new entry to
the Changelog at the bottom so the next session can pick up the
narrative.**

---

## Project at a glance

- **Aphelion Star Fighter** — 2D canvas space combat. The repo plans
  to ship to iOS/Android via Capacitor.
- **Stack**: Vite + vanilla JS (ES modules) + Capacitor. No
  TypeScript, no framework. Rendering is plain `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.
- **Entry points**:
  - `index.html` → loads `src/main.js`.
  - `src/main.js` — sets up canvas, fixed-timestep loop, draw order.
  - `src/game.js` — match lifecycle, damage rules, per-tick update.
- **Tooling**:
  - `npm run dev` — Vite dev server.
  - `npm run build` — production build → `dist/`.
  - `npm run cap:sync` — build + sync to native platforms.

## Module layout (`src/`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `main.js` | RAF loop, canvas/camera, draw order. |
| `game.js` | `createGame`/`startGame`/`update`/`restart`, damage resolution, score, match-end logic. |
| `ship.js` | `createShip`, `updateShip` (movement + weapons), `drawShip`. Hull polygons + visual extras live here. |
| `ai.js` | Per-ship AI: target selection, throttle, fire decisions. |
| `projectile.js` | Cannon + missile entities, including homing missile logic. |
| `wreckage.js` | Persistent map litter — destroyed-ship hulks + impact debris. |
| `arena.js` | Arena bounds + starfield + map size presets. |
| `classes.js` | Base per-class ship specs + `SIDES` color palette. |
| `races.js` | Per-race overrides + rosters. `resolveSpec(race, klass)` deep-merges. |
| `input.js` | Touch/mouse/keyboard input, on-screen joysticks, start menu, hangar entry. |
| `hud.js` | In-game HUD (minimap, score, beams). |
| `audio.js` | Web Audio synth + event subscribers. |
| `events.js` | Tiny pub/sub bus shared across the game. |
| `save.js` | Versioned localStorage SaveStore (schema-migrated). |
| `cosmetics.js`, `hangar.js`, `progression.js` | Meta-progression + cosmetics. |
| `modes/{arena,waves,daily}.js` | Mode hooks: `setup`, `tick`, `checkEnd`. |
| `modes/index.js` | Mode registry. |
| `types.js` | JSDoc typedefs (no runtime exports). |
| `vec.js` | Tiny 2D vector helpers. |

## Key conventions

- **No framework.** Plain ES modules, exported functions, no classes
  unless there's clear lifecycle (e.g. `SaveStore`, `EventBus`,
  `StartMenu`, `InputManager`).
- **Comments**: the codebase favors `//` block comments above
  non-obvious logic, explaining *why* (gameplay intent, math
  reasoning, perf concerns) rather than *what*.
- **Event bus**: gameplay code in `game.js`/`ship.js` emits domain
  events (`weaponFired`, `hit`, `shipDestroyed`, etc). `audio.js`,
  `progression.js`, and others subscribe. Don't reach across modules
  directly — emit/subscribe.
- **Save schema**: `save.js` has `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` and a
  `MIGRATIONS` registry. `mergeWithDefaults` deep-merges so
  *additive* fields to `menuSelection` / `settings` / etc. don't
  need an explicit migration step. Bumping the version is only
  needed when the *shape* changes incompatibly.
- **Damage layers**: shield → armor (capitals only) → hull. Implemented
  in `applyDamage` in `game.js`. Missiles bypass shields. Lasers and
  fighter cannons cost only 50% from the shield bank. Armor wears at
  `spec.armor.wearRate`.
- **Fixed timestep**: `main.js` accumulates real time and steps
  `update(game, 1/60)` until the accumulator drains. Don't sleep, poll
  `performance.now()`, or assume `dt` varies wildly.
- **Coordinate space**: world is in pixels; arena bounds set by
  `setArenaSize`. Camera follows player (or spectate target) and is
  scaled by `ZOOM` (0.5) in `main.js`.
- **Hull polygons**: defined in `src/ship.js` as `HULLS[race][klass]`,
  vertex coords in unit space scaled by `spec.radius` at draw time.
  `getHull(race, klass)` is exported so `wreckage.js` can reuse them.
- **Ship state mutability**: `ship.controller` is updated each frame
  from input/AI; the rest of the ship is mutated by `updateShip`.
  Avoid stashing extra state on ships unless it has a clear owner.

## Render order (main.js draw)

1. Arena background + starfield.
2. Camera transform applied.
3. Arena bounds.
4. **Wrecks** (under live ships).
5. Live ships.
6. **Debris** (on top of ships).
7. Projectiles.
8. Beams (HUD module).
9. Restore transform; HUD; virtual sticks.

## Things to know before changing rendering

- All world-space draws happen inside the camera transform applied in
  `main.js#draw`. HUD draws after `ctx.restore()` so screen-space
  layout is unaffected by camera scale.
- `drawShip` applies its own `ctx.save/translate/rotate/restore` so
  per-ship sub-draws can use ship-local coords directly.
- `getHull(race, klass)` returns unit-space polygon vertices in
  `[[x, y], ...]` form, ranges roughly `[-1, 1]`. Multiply by
  `ship.spec.radius` to scale to world units.

## Subsystem cheat sheet

- **Carrier replenishment**: every `spec.replenish.fighter` and
  `spec.replenish.bomber` seconds, the carrier launches a new escort.
- **PD turrets**: ring of N positions on the hull (see
  `pdTurretOffset`); each picks: missile → bomber → fighter → nearest.
- **Pack AI**: `game.packs` is rebuilt each tick from ships with a
  matching `packId`. Each pack picks a target by role
  (`hunt-fighter`, `strike-capital`, `skirmish-frigate`), with bombers
  pulling rank over the role preference.

### 2026-05-21 — Frontier mode launch: drop dead `makeGalaxy`, fix SVG className write

**What changed**

Tapping NEW CAMPAIGN never opened the run-setup screen. Two latent
bugs from the DOM/CSS overhaul (a6f0f28):

1. `StartMenu._layoutRunSetup` still called `makeGalaxy(...)` to build
   a canvas backdrop. `makeGalaxy` was deleted from `starmap.js` when
   the canvas starmap was rewritten as DOM/SVG — the symbol isn't
   imported and isn't exported anywhere. The click handler threw
   `ReferenceError`, `showRunSetup` never flipped to true, and the
   tap silently did nothing.
2. After picking a faction, `updateStarmap` threw twice:
   - `edgesSvg = control.edgesSvg;` (line 439) was a bare-name
     assignment with no `let`/`const`. In ES-module strict mode that
     reads as a global lookup, so the implicit global never existed
     and the line ReferenceError'd on the first edge build.
   - `edgeEl.path.setAttribute("d", ...)` was followed by
     `edgeEl.path.className = ...` on an SVG `<path>`. `SVGElement`'s
     `className` is a read-only `SVGAnimatedString` getter — setting
     it raises `TypeError`. SVG class writes have to go through
     `setAttribute("class", ...)` or `classList`.

After both: run setup opens, faction pick works, starmap mounts (16
nodes / 22 edges in the smoke test) and the Frontier campaign is
playable again.

**Files touched**

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/input.js` | Dropped the `_runSetupGalaxy = makeGalaxy(...)` block from `_layoutRunSetup`. The run setup is fully DOM-rendered; `_drawRunSetup` is already a stub and `_runSetupGalaxy` had no readers. |
| `src/starmap.js` | Replaced bare `edgesSvg = control.edgesSvg; edgesSvg.appendChild(path)` with `control.edgesSvg.appendChild(path)`. Replaced `edgeEl.path.className = ...` with `edgeEl.path.setAttribute("class", ...)`. |

**Design decisions / gotchas**

- **The other `.className = ...` sites in starmap.js are safe.** They
  all assign to HTML elements (`div`, `button`), where `className` is
  a writable string. Only the `<path>` (and any other SVG namespace
  element) needs `setAttribute("class", ...)`. If a future change
  adds an SVG `<g>`/`<circle>`/etc., the same gotcha applies.
- **Dead canvas paths left in `_layoutRunSetup` and `_clickRunSetup`
  on purpose.** The DOM scrim absorbs the canvas clicks, so the
  legacy rect-based fallback is unreachable from the primary flow.
  Removing it would be a separate "kill dead canvas menu code"
  sweep — out of scope for the launch fix.
- **Verified end-to-end via Playwright** (Galaxy S9+ UA): tap
  Frontier → tap NEW CAMPAIGN → faction-grid opens with 4 cards →
  tap Terran → `starmap-root` appears in the body, `.starmap-node`
  count = 16, `path.starmap-edge` count = 22, no pageerrors.

### 2026-05-21 — Real fix for the startup black screen: restore InputManager.layoutOverlays

**What changed**

The previous "Fix black screen on initial load" commit (3f9e997) added
an `input.startMenu.draw(...)` call to the draw loop, assuming the
menu DOM wasn't mounting because nothing was calling its draw method.
It treated the wrong symptom — the draw loop never ran at all.

The DOM/CSS menu overhaul (a6f0f28) deleted
`InputManager.layoutOverlays(viewW, viewH)` because the overlays moved
to DOM, but it left the call site in `main.js#resize()`. `resize()`
fires synchronously during module init (line 262, `resize()` after
the listener is attached), BEFORE the RAF loop starts. The missing
method raises a TypeError, the module top-level execution dies, and
no frame ever paints.

This was undetectable from grepping the live deployment because the
fix commit was authored *after* the breaking commit was already in
the wild — every user loading the page since the menu overhaul has
been hitting a black screen, regardless of cache state.

Restored `layoutOverlays` as a five-line method on `InputManager`
that delegates to the still-existing per-overlay `layout()` methods
(missileBtn, fireBtn, spectateBtn, startMenu, admiralPanel — same
list the original method had).

**Files touched**

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/input.js` | Re-added `layoutOverlays(viewW, viewH)` on `InputManager`. |

**Design decisions / gotchas**

- **The per-overlay `layout()` methods still matter even with the
  DOM HUD.** `onDown` still hit-tests canvas rects on
  `missileBtn`/`fireBtn`/`spectateBtn`/`boostBtn`. Without `layout()`
  calls those rects stay at `{x:0,y:0,w:90,h:60}` — i.e. they'd
  steal taps in the top-left corner of the canvas. Don't be tempted
  to delete the call thinking "everything is DOM now."
- **`boostBtn` is intentionally NOT in the layout list.** It has no
  `layout()` method (its rect is set elsewhere or unused). Adding
  it would throw the same TypeError.
- **Verification was done in a real browser (headless chromium via
  Playwright with a Samsung S24 UA + viewport)** — `bodyChildren`
  now includes `#menu-root` and `#battle-root`, `activeScreen`
  reads `main`, the DEPLOY button text is present. The earlier
  static-analysis pass missed this because the bug is a runtime
  TypeError at module top-level, not a logic bug in any of the
  branches that get drawn.
- **The 3f9e997 fix is still correct** in the narrow sense that
  `startMenu.draw` needed re-mounting after the DOM overhaul
  dropped `drawHUD` from the loop — once `resize()` stops throwing
  the menu draw call WILL fire. Don't revert it. The two fixes
  together are what makes the page actually work.
- **Cache impact**: served `src/main.js` has `Cache-Control:
  public, max-age=60`. Users hard-refresh or wait 60s, then a
  conditional request returns the fresh module. No deploy step
  needed beyond saving the file — `/play/starfighter/` serves
  directly from this working tree.

### 2026-05-20 — AI targets PD + weapon modules before hull

**What changed**

AI ships were sending cannon fire at the dead centre of capital
targets — visually clean but tactically pointless, since the
defensive modules (PD turrets, broadside batteries, missile bays)
sat untouched until the hull bar finally dropped. With the recent
HP_TIER_MUL pass + the defense buff, capital hulls take 90–150s to
chew through; the player wants module destruction to feel like the
shortcut, and AI fire that lands on hull only contributes to grind.

Now: any AI ship aiming a cannon at a target with live modules
shifts its aim onto the next live module, in priority order:
**PD → broadside → missile bay / pod → torpedo bay → laser → hangar.**
Engines are intentionally NOT in the priority — they're rear-mounted
and the natural strafe angle usually clips something else first.
Fighter targets and any capital with no live modules left fall back
to centre aim.

The targeting helper (`pickAimModule`) is shared with the existing
`pickBomberAimModule` so bomber missile homing keeps the same
behaviour for free. As soon as a module is destroyed all aiming
ships re-target the next one on the priority list — which produces
natural focus fire (everyone hits the same PD turret first, then
moves on once it's gone).

**Files touched**

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/modules.js` | New `pickAimModule(target)` returns the module object (not just name) for general AI use; `pickBomberAimModule` re-implemented as a thin wrapper. New `moduleOffsetWorld(ship, module)` returns the world-space anchor — same math as `moduleWorldPos` but takes the module reference directly so callers holding it from `pickAimModule` skip the name lookup. Aim priority extracted as `AIM_PRIORITY` constant. |
| `src/ai.js` | New `aimPointFor(target)` returns the world-space aim point (preferred module world position, or target centre). `leadAim` rebuilt around it so every AI ship calling leadAim (currently fighter strafing in `flybyAI`) automatically gets module-aware aim. Velocity-lead still uses target velocity, not module velocity — they're identical since modules ride with the ship. |
| `src/ship.js` | `updateRingFire` (frigate ring cannons) shifts its lead-aim onto the preferred module when present. PD turrets keep their existing dispatch — they target missiles + small craft, not modules. |

**Design decisions / gotchas**

- **Priority order matches `pickBomberAimModule`.** Bomber missile
  homing already used this ordering and the behaviour was good;
  unifying the helper means there's one place to retune. If you
  want fighter cannons to deprioritise PD (because PD has too
  little HP to be a worthwhile target), edit `AIM_PRIORITY` in
  modules.js — bomber missile aim will follow automatically.
- **Engines not in the priority list.** Adding engines would make
  fighters strafing from behind always aim at engine modules,
  which on capitals are clustered close to the centre anyway and
  feels less satisfying as a tactical choice. Players can still
  manually aim at engines.
- **Focus fire is emergent.** Every ship picks the *first* live
  module in the priority list. With ~50 fighters all looking at
  the same battleship, they all aim at the same PD turret until
  it dies, then all shift to the next. Don't add randomisation
  inside `pickAimModule` — the focus-fire pattern is the win.
- **Velocity lead is target.vel, not module.vel.** Modules ride
  with the ship; their world-space velocity is identical. The
  one frame of staleness from `aimPt` being computed before the
  velocity application is irrelevant at the leading time scale
  (<0.3 s for fighter rounds).
- **Aim only — not target selection.** AI ships still PICK their
  target via the existing pack-role / proximity logic. The module
  priority only kicks in once a target has been chosen. Don't try
  to make a fighter pick its target based on module presence;
  that would route fighters away from other fighters and break
  the existing escort / pack dynamics.
- **`pickAimModule` returns the module object so callers can read
  `offset` without a second lookup.** Don't change it to return
  just a name — that would force `moduleByName[name]` everywhere
  it's used in AI paths.
- **Battleship `rush` mode aim left unchanged.** BB rush sets
  heading at the target so the ship physically moves toward it.
  Module aim shifts heading by a few degrees, which is
  imperceptible at capital ranges. BB broadside fire is auto-arc
  dispatch — it doesn't lead a specific point. Carrier has no
  cannons. Cruiser is missile/laser artillery, not a cannon
  platform.

### 2026-05-20 — Frontier UI overhaul: starmap + scrollable galaxy + emblem cards

**What changed**

The roguelite UI shipped as flat geometric chips on a small centred
panel — the chart felt like a debug view, not a campaign. This pass
rewrites the campaign UI to read like an FTL-style sector chart:

1. **Full-screen scrollable starmap.** The run map fills the viewport
   instead of sitting in a 1100×720 panel. World rect is ~1.55×
   viewport so the player drags to pan around the chart. Parallax
   stars (3 depth layers) + 2-3 procedural nebula clouds tint the
   backdrop. Map opens centred on the player's current position.
2. **Node art per type.** Nodes render as celestial bodies — battle
   stars (red corona with faction-tinted glint ring), elite stars
   (same with rotating 4-point flare cross), resupply planets
   (blue-green with atmosphere halo), event anomalies (purple swirl
   with rotating arcs + `?`), boss gas giants with rings tinted by
   the boss faction. Locked nodes desaturate; reachable pulse softly;
   current node gets a "you-are-here" second pulse ring.
3. **Curved travel routes** (quadratic Bezier with seeded
   perpendicular bulge). The active route from the current node has
   an animated dashed-flow shimmer.
4. **Drag-to-pan.** Pointer-down anywhere on the map starts a
   pan-drag. Threshold of 4px distinguishes tap vs pan; a pan
   release skips node-click routing, a tap fires the click as
   before.
5. **Top HUD strip** with act badge, faction commander label, and
   credit/fuel chips with icons. Right-edge fleet panel rebuilt
   with per-class procedural ship silhouettes + HP bars +
   iconified small-craft rows.
6. **Fuel-cost chips** along reachable edges (red if you can't
   afford the jump, blue if you can).
7. **Run Setup redesign.** Galaxy backdrop + faction emblem cards
   (procedural sigil roundels — Terran 5-point star, Reavers
   skull-triangle, Hegemony cross, Voidsworn hexagram). Selected
   card scales gently and gets the faction-coloured stroke. War
   record trophy at the card foot.

**Files touched**

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `src/starmap.js` *(new)* | Procedural art module. `makeGalaxy(seed,w,h)` builds deterministic 3-layer starfield + nebula clouds. `drawGalaxy` paints with parallax. `nodePositionsFor` spreads col/row grid across world rect with seeded jitter. `drawCurvedEdge` quadratic Bezier with flow shimmer. `drawNodeArt` dispatches per node type. `drawFleetMarker` (wing silhouette). `drawFactionEmblem` (per-faction sigils). `clampPan` keeps pan within world bounds. |
| `src/input.js` | `_layoutRunMap` rewritten — full-screen world rect with cached galaxy + node positions keyed on `(run.seed, run.act)`. `_centerPanOnCurrent` so a fresh open centres on the player. `_drawRunMap` rewritten — galaxy backdrop, curved edges, node art, fleet marker, fuel-cost chips, top HUD strip. `_drawFleetPanel` rebuilt with capital silhouettes + HP bars. New `_drawCapitalGlyph` for per-class shapes. `_clickRunMap` converts pointer coords to world space. `_startRunMapDrag`/`_moveRunMapDrag`/`_endRunMapDrag` handle pan + drag-vs-tap distinction. `StartMenu.pointerMove`/`pointerUp` extended for the deferred-click flow. `_drawRunSetup`/`_layoutRunSetup` rewritten for galaxy + emblem cards. |

**Design decisions / gotchas**

- **Click is deferred to pointer-up for the run map only.** Sub-
  overlays (Battle Choice, Event, Resupply, Run Setup) still route
  clicks on pointer-down because they're modal and don't need
  drag detection. Don't unify the two paths.
- **Drag threshold is 4px (squared 16).** Below = tap, above = pan.
  Bump to 6-8 if testers report missed taps on phones.
- **Pan is clamped via `clampPan`** with 80px slack so edge stars
  remain visible at the limits.
- **Galaxy + node positions cached on `(run.seed, run.act)`.**
  Changing acts mid-run regenerates both — by design, each act
  feels like a new region.
- **Node-position jitter** uses 0.18 scale at entry/boss columns
  (anchors) and 0.45 in the middle (organic chart feel).
- **The legacy `_drawNodeIcon` method is now dead code** — left in
  place to keep the diff focused. Safe to delete in a follow-up.
- **`drawFactionEmblem` accepts hex OR rgba()** via the internal
  `factionRgba` normaliser. Add HSL handling there if a race ever
  uses one.
- **`drawFleetMarker` sits 38px ABOVE the current node** with a
  pip line down — keeps the marker from obscuring the star.
- **The Run Setup galaxy uses a fixed seed (`0xfd00bea1`)** so the
  starscape stays consistent across opens. Don't randomise it.
- **Boss ring system is a flat ellipse**, not a proper occluded
  ring. The occlusion trick tripled draw cost; current read is
  "obvious gas giant" which is enough.

## Earlier changelog (condensed)

Older entries collapsed to date + headline + key load-bearing gotchas.
For full context (what changed, files touched, verification steps),
see `git log` — every entry shipped as its own commit.

### 2026-05-20 — Frontier roguelite campaign (replaces 100-mission campaign)

FTL-style roguelite: branching node maps per act, 3 acts per run,
capital ships carry hull damage between battles, small craft drip-
replenish, two currencies (credits + fuel). Loss = all capitals
destroyed. Mid-run save/resume mandatory. Replaces `src/campaign.js`
with `src/roguelite.js` + `src/modes/roguelite.js`. Save schema v3.

- **Per-instance capital identity** via `runtimeInstanceId` stamped
  during spawn. Manifest is an ordered array popped by `spawnRoster`
  in declaration order; relies on `Object.entries(roster)` iterating
  capitals before small craft (V8 insertion-order spec).
- **Only hull persists**, not shields/armor — legible match to the
  run-map HP readout; persisting regenerating defenses would be
  invisible to the player.
- **`MODES.tick` and `MODES.checkEnd` were dead** before this entry;
  now wired in `update()`. The `matchEnded` event was also subscribed
  but never emitted — now emitted from `update()` on the edge,
  gated by `game._matchEndedEmitted`.
- **Boss-win clears the run synchronously.** `main.js`'s
  `matchEnded` handler snapshots `runRef` up front because the
  `runEnded` dispatch nulls out `activeRun` mid-flight.
- **Energy gate skipped for roguelite battles** — the run itself is
  the energy commitment. Frontier chip opens an overlay rather than
  calling `_emitStart`.
- **`unlockedFactions` is the 5th-race extensibility gate.** Adding
  a race is data-only: entry in `RACES` + key in
  `DEFAULT_SAVE.roguelite.meta.unlockedFactions`.
- **Tunables at top of `src/roguelite.js`**: `STARTER_FLEET`,
  `FIGHTER_DRIP`, `BOMBER_DRIP`, `REPAIR_RATE`.

### 2026-05-20 — Defensive systems buff pass: shields, armor, PD, stations

Shields ~1.6–1.8× higher max with faster regen. Capital armor max
~1.5–1.6× with lower wearRate. PD count/range/RoF bumped across the
line. Stations significantly buffed (base hp 600 → 950, radius 70 →
80). Station-node weapon templates (`PD_BASE`, `MISSILES_BASE`,
`LASER_BASE` in races.js) bumped so every race's stations inherit.
Shield bubble offset factor 0.18 → 0.22 (floor 6 → 8). PD turret
draw radius 2 → 3.

- **PD anti-ship multiplier `PD_VS_SHIP_MUL = 0.22` untouched.** PD
  buff is anti-missile, not anti-ship. If PD shreds fighters again,
  lower the multiplier — don't revert the damage values.
- **`PD_BASE` change affects every station** because all races layer
  mods on top. Per-race differentiation requires explicit overrides.
- **Capital fights are 90–150 s** after this + the HP_TIER_MUL pass.
  Module destruction is the practical accelerator.
- **Shield offset floor 6 → 8.** Fighters get a 9px bubble. Preserve
  the floor — small classes need it.

### 2026-05-20 — Procedural SFX + SFX mute + shield impact visual

Four SFX voices (`sfxCannon`/`sfxMissile`/`sfxHit`/`sfxExplosion`) on a
separate `sfxGain` bus from music. Gameplay events
(`weaponFired`/`missileFired`/`hit`/`shipDestroyed`) routed through
`main.js` with camera-attenuated volume. Shield impact = outward
ripple + localized arc flare on bubble (up to 6 active flares,
0.45 s fade, stored ship-local so they ride manoeuvring capitals).
Settings overlay grew an SFX toggle row.

- **`sfxGain` separate from music compressor** — the whole point of
  the per-bus mute is independent muting.
- **Per-frame voice budget = 6.** Events still fire (cheap), only
  first 6 hit synth each frame. Gates at audio layer, not events.
- **AI weapon SFX probability-gated at 35%.** Cheapest knob if SFX
  mix gets too noisy in big brawls.
- **Player events bypass attenuation** via `isPlayer: true`.
- **`shieldHits` bounded at 6**, older entries shift out.
- **`recordShieldHit` localizes by `-ship.heading`** so arcs ride
  with the turning ship. Don't store world angles.

### 2026-05-20 — Engine fire + hull venting VFX scaling with damage

Engine modules route through `spawnEnginePlumeVFX` — dark smoke +
flame jets backward along ship heading, severity ramps with HP.
Below 70% hull HP every ship emits hull-vent smoke from random
points; above ~55% severity it sparks fire. Module smoke/fire rates
roughly doubled (`DAMAGED_RATE` 3.5 → 7, `DISABLED_RATE` 12 → 22).

- **Engine vents backward**, not outward — drift along
  `ship.heading + π`. Reorient via per-engine vector, not in the
  spawner.
- **Hull vent points sampled per-frame**, not stored. For "this
  section breached" effects later, add `ship.ventPoints`.
- **No off-screen culling.** Poisson rate gate keeps spawn counts
  manageable; add culling only on real perf regression.
- **Severity formula `(0.70 - hpFrac) / 0.60`** linear, clamped.
  Keep trigger at 0.70 — earlier and ships look broken on scratch.
- **Engine severity floor 0.45** ensures damaged-state engines emit
  meaningful smoke, not barely-there puffs.

### 2026-05-20 — Pinch zoom + non-linear capital HP + crater-style hull damage

Pinch-zoom (touch) + scroll-wheel (desktop) in spectator + admiral
only, clamped `[0.15, 2.0]`, default 0.5. `HP_TIER_MUL` table
(fighter 1.0 → carrier/BB 4.5) applied AFTER race deep-merge in
`resolveSpec`. Floating rind/orange-rim hull-hole artwork replaced
with dark sooty craters matching destroyed-module visual language.
Armor-flake palette muted to gray.

- **Zoom only in spectator + admiral.** Piloting keeps default —
  aim feel depends on known scale. Don't bolt on without an opt-in.
- **Pinch baseline drops on finger lift** — next gesture starts
  fresh, otherwise zoom lurches on re-engage.
- **HP tier mul AFTER race deep-merge.** Hegemony BB 1500 / Reavers
  BB 770 preserved proportionally. For race-specific scaling, add
  `hpMul` to the race spec.
- **Cell-hull-cost NOT scaled.** Only ~14% of BB hull drainable via
  cells; rest drains directly in `applyDamage`. Visible damage
  outpaces HP bar drop on capitals — intentional.

### 2026-05-20 — Custom Match: slider-driven roster redesign

Custom Match overlay rebuilt: wider 460px panels, per-class sliders
replace +/− buttons (8px visible track, full-row hit zone, tap-to-snap
+ drag both supported), 1×4 race row, ALLIED/HOSTILE headers.

- **Tap-to-snap + drag are the same gesture.** Pointer-down inside
  hit-zone sets value AND opens drag.
- **Slider hit zone is row-tall**, not just the 8px track. Inflated
  hit-zone is why the redesign earns its keep.
- **`_customDrag` cleared on CANCEL/START/pointer-up.** Stale drag
  would re-engage on next open via cached row reference.
- **`pointerMove`/`pointerUp` only fire while `menuActive`** — early
  return is gated so virtual-stick handling is untouched.
- **Race chip click re-seeds counts** to the new race's default
  roster. Swap race FIRST, then tune.

### 2026-05-20 — HUD polish: unified panel chrome + spectator vitals

`drawPlayerHUD` → `drawVitalsPanel`, reused for spectated ships
(outside admiral mode — admiral panel owns the bottom). Match-over
+ respawn now in centered panels with the standard chrome.

- **Spectate vitals suppressed in admiral mode** via `!game.admiralMode`
  guard in `drawHUD`.
- **`drawVitalsPanel` only reads fields present on every ship.**
  Missile block double-gated on `missileBtn && ship.spec.missile`.
- **Border tint keyed on `ship.isPlayer`, not side** — captured/recycled
  ships should still read as "me".
- **Match-over panel accent uses `SIDES[winner].primary`** — red on
  loss is deliberate.

### 2026-05-20 — Custom Match: player-configurable per-side rosters + races

`startGame` now dispatches via `MODES[mode].setup` with
`{ spawnRoster, promotePlayer }` helpers. `spawnRoster(game,
rosterOverride)` accepts per-side overrides. Custom Match overlay
populates `game.customRoster`.

- **Mode dispatch is dispatch-or-fall-through, not dispatch-only.**
  Open/defend hit the legacy path. Don't refactor MODES to require a
  hook.
- **Fleet-size multiplier bypassed for custom + campaign** — counts
  are deliberate.
- **Per-class cap 60.** Raising melts phones; renderer fill-time
  budget is the real ceiling.
- **Overlay layout recomputed on open**, not on resize. Reopen
  fixes stale rects.

### 2026-05-20 — Multi-stage salvos for BB + cruiser; PD damage nerfed vs ships

PD damage scaled to `PD_VS_SHIP_MUL = 0.22` against ships when
`p.fromKlass === "pd"`. BB broadsides + cruiser forward gained
`salvo: { shotsPerVolley, intraShotDelay }` — burst at current aim
instead of single shells. Per-shot heading recomputed for tracking.

- **Salvo continues past `c.firing = false`** — committed-volley
  feel. AI swapping targets mid-burst still delivers the volley.
- **`updateBroadsideFire` recomputes `sideVec` each shot** so turning
  battleships don't spray glued at initial vector.
- **PD nerf keyed on `p.fromKlass === "pd"`.** Tag any new PD-class
  source with this — don't introduce a second multiplier.
- **Cooldown starts at volley start, not end.** Don't drop cooldown
  below `shotsPerVolley * intraShotDelay` — volleys overlap and
  double-fire.

### 2026-05-20 — Per-type module art + capital-scale shield standoff

Per-kind module icons (laser barrel + lens, missile silo grid,
broadside cannon row, animated dual-barrel PD turret, hangar bay
chevron, torpedo cross-hair, engine nozzle ring). Shield offset
`Math.max(6, s.radius * 0.18)` — capitals get +28–32 px standoff.

- **PD turret rotation uses `performance.now() + ship.id * 0.37`** —
  phase keeps a swarm from spinning in lockstep.
- **Damage chip chrome paints OVER icons** at low HP — intentional.
- **Shield floor 6px preserves small-craft bubble.** Don't lower
  below 4.

### 2026-05-20 — Bigger modules, chip-damage VFX, pixel hulls per class

All MODULES radii bumped ~35% so visible disc = hit zone. drawShip
render mult 0.55 → 0.85. 5 damage stages per module (pristine →
crack → wedge → red-hot → crater) with transition spark + smoke.
Cell grid 3-4× finer per class (`CELL_HP` fighter 1 → station 5,
`CELL_HULL_COST` fighter 0.25 → station 1.0). `damageCellsInRadius`
budget-based, inner-first. `deadCells[]` cache on each ship.

- **`cell.hpMax` no longer per-cell** — uniform via `ship.cellHpMax`.
- **Budget cap (`remaining * 1.2`) lives in `applyDamage`**, not
  `damageCellsInRadius`. Raising it lets beam ticks punch ribbons.
- **Damage-stage thresholds duplicated** in `drawShip` + `moduleStage()`
  — keep in lockstep.
- **Wounded-cell halo skips below `screenRadius < 12px`** — retune
  on camera ZOOM change, don't remove.
- **`auditModuleLayout()` dev-only** via `import.meta.env.DEV`.

### 2026-05-19 — Fighters/bombers stop dodging; per-capital fighter escorts; bombers flank

Fighter `danger` weight 1.95 → 0.55, bomber 2.20 → 0.85.
`bigShipDanger` excludes the current target. `MAX_APPROACH_TIME`
10 → 16 s; forced break-off on PD bubble entry removed. Per-capital
escorts via `ESCORT_SIZE` map (frigate 5, cruiser 10, BB 15, carrier
10). Bomber AI renamed `bomberStandoffAI` → `bomberFlankAI` —
perpendicular-aft flank slot.

- **Target-exclude is targeted.** Fighters still flinch from OTHER
  capitals. Don't fold new avoidance classes (mines, hazards) into
  this exclusion without thought.
- **No pack-leash on escorts.** The bomber IS the threat — chasing
  is correct. If you add a leash, use `escortOf` lookup.
- **`ESCORT_SIZE` in game.js is the single source.** Legacy
  `spec.escortSize` field is gone — don't reintroduce.
- **Fleet sizes balloon (~103 ships/side Terran, ~128 Hegemony).**
  Frame rate lever is `ESCORT_SIZE`, not the roster.
- **Bomber flank uses target heading where available** — target
  velocity would park bombers behind sliding cruisers.

### 2026-05-19 — Cruiser refit: long-range artillery (cluster + siege missiles + laser)

Cruiser dropped `weapon` + `firingMode: "forward"` entirely. Now:
2× cluster missile pods (split into 5 children on approach), 1×
siege missile (240 dmg, 18 s, hp 10), single bow heavy laser.
`aiOrbit: 880 → 1500`.

- **Cluster `missilePods.damage` is per CHILD now** (5 × 30 = 150).
- **Children home on parent's target**, spread is spatial only —
  forces multiple PD intercepts.
- **Children don't carry `.cluster`** — only pod-spawned missiles
  do. No recursive cluster.
- **Siege shares the `"missile"` subsystem gate** with cluster pods.
- **`s.weapon` may be undefined** (cruiser + carrier). AI code that
  touches `s.weapon.x` must guard.
- **AI orbit 1500** feels right at 4500–11000 px maps; shrink maps
  → dial it down.

### 2026-05-19 — Heavy laser is now a 3-second sustained beam; AI dodges it

BB heavy laser `beamDuration: 0.45 → 3.0`. Damage spreads as
`dps = damage / beamDuration`. Beam re-anchors to owner bow each
tick. Dies on owner death or laser-subsystem kill. AI dodges via
`beamAvoidance` overlay applied to every class.

- **Continuous damage routes through `applyDamage`** — same
  shield/armor/subsystem/hull pipeline as a cannon round.
- **Subsystem hits route through node closest to target centre** —
  almost always engine on a fleeing target. Intentional.
- **`beam.side` is the OWNER's side** — friendly avoidance skips via
  `beam.side === ship.side`.
- **AI force-clears `firing` on high urgency** — looks decisive,
  prevents re-acquiring beam-camped targets.
- **No path-prediction lookahead** — adds oscillation near beam
  edges. Don't add without verifying AI doesn't dither.

### 2026-05-19 — Destructible subsystem nodes (gun / engine / missile / laser)

Ships carry `subsystems` array — hit-routed nodes that disable
behaviors when destroyed (gun → cannons off, engine → drift,
missile → pods off, laser → beam off). PD turrets intentionally
excluded (swarm, not a node). `applyDamage` Step 3 absorbs into
node, overflow continues to hull.

- **Routing opt-in via aim** — player has to land in the hit-radius.
  AI aims at centre, so AI hits only graze nodes occasionally —
  deliberate player edge.
- **Overflow continues to hull** — killing blows aren't wasted on
  node HP. Avoids the spongy-ship trap.
- **`hpFrac` is fraction of `ship.hpMax`** — race HP overrides scale
  subsystem HP for free.
- **`hasWorkingSubsystem(ship, kind)` returns true if no nodes of
  that kind exist** (e.g. carrier has no `gun`). Always go through
  the helper.
- **Engine kill behavior differs by class** — aircraft coast
  (`vel *= 0.995`), capitals drift (`vel *= 0.99`).
- **Hit point comes from `applyDamage(... hitPos)`**. New callers
  MUST supply `hitPos` or the subsystem step bails.

### 2026-05-19 — Ship visuals, opponent picker, persistent wreckage

`src/wreckage.js` (new) — destroyed ships leave drifting fractured
hulks, damaging hits chip debris fragments. Both persist for the
match. Arena gained an OPPONENT picker (random + four races; muted
in waves/daily). Ships got engine plumes, race-accent spine,
cockpit/bridge markers, panel lines, HP-driven scorch marks.

- **Wreckage caps: 160 wrecks, 500 debris.** Oldest dropped on
  overflow. Don't age them out by time — persistence is intentional.
- **Hull-chunk splitter shares centroid as fan apex** — adjacent
  chunks share their edge so the union reproduces the silhouette.
  Last chunk wraps `poly[V % V] === poly[0]`.
- **`SIDES.blue.primary === "#5cf"`** (3-hex). `darken()` handles
  both 3- and 6-hex; don't assume 6.
- **Engine plume tint keyed on `ship.side`**, not race — team ID at
  a glance even if races mix later.
- **Battle scars use deterministic hash of `ship.id`** — stable
  frame-to-frame without storing scar state on the ship.
- **`mergeWithDefaults` deep-merges menuSelection/settings** — new
  additive fields don't need a schema bump.
